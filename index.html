   <h3>My Travel Exprience</h3> 
   <p>One of my passions is travelling. Travel involves visiting new places and meeting new people and having varied experiences.</p>

    <h4>Another Experience i share with you</h4>
    <p> I come originally from Romania and have travelled to UK and US. I remember the quote by Samuel Johnson: “All travel has its advantages. If the passenger visits better countries, he may learn to improve his own. And if fortune carries him to worse, he may learn to enjoy it”. I have had the luck of visiting better countries and I believe my travel experiences have taught me a lot about human life and helped me expand the way I see things.</p>
